    "There are a few things you should keep in mind here. Read these carefully, as these tips will save you a lot of time in your implementation.\n",
    "1. Transformer models make use of Byte-Pair Encodings (BPE), that chunk up a piece of next in subword pieces. For example, a word such as \"largely\" could be chunked up into \"large\" and \"ly\". We are interested in probing linguistic information on the __word__-level. Therefore, we will follow the suggestion of Hewitt et al. (2019a, footnote 4), and create the representation of a word by averaging over the representations of its subwords. So the representation of \"largely\" becomes the average of that of \"large\" and \"ly\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Subword chunks never overlap multiple tokens. In other words, say we have a phrase like \"None of the\", then the tokenizer might chunk that into \"No\"+\"ne\"+\" of\"+\" the\", but __not__ into \"No\"+\"ne o\"+\"f the\", as those chunks overlap multiple tokens. This is great for our setup! Otherwise it would have been quite challenging to distribute the representation of a subword over the 2 tokens it belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Important**: If you closely examine the provided treebank, you will notice that some tokens are split up into multiple pieces, that each have their own POS-tag. For example, in the first sentence the word \"Al-Zaman\" is split into \"Al\", \"-\", and \"Zaman\". In such cases, the conllu `TokenList` format will add the following attribute: `('misc', OrderedDict([('SpaceAfter', 'No')]))` to these tokens. Your model's tokenizer does not need to adhere to the same tokenization. E.g., \"Al-Zaman\" could be split into \"Al-\"+\"Za\"+\"man\", making it hard to match the representations with their correct pos-tag. Therefore I recommend you to not tokenize your entire sentence at once, but to do this based on the chunking of the treebank. <br /><br />\n",
    "Make sure to still incoporate the spaces in a sentence though, as these are part of the BPE of the tokenizer. That is, the tokenizer uses a different token id for `\"man\"`, than it does for `\" man\"`: the former could be part of `\" woman\"`=`\" wo`\"+`\"man\"`, whereas the latter would be the used in case *man* occurs at the start of a word. The tokenizer for GPT-2 adds spaces at the start of a token (represented as a `Ġ` symbol). This means that you should keep track whether the previous token had the `SpaceAfter` attribute set to `'No'`: in case it did not, you should manually prepend a `\" \"` ahead of the token.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The LSTM LM does not have the issues related to subwords, but is far more restricted in its vocabulary. Make sure you keep the above points in mind though, when creating the LSTM representations. You might want to write separate functions for the LSTM, but that is up to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The huggingface transformer models don't return the hidden state by default. To achieve this you can pass `output_hidden_states=True` to a model forward pass. The hidden states are then returned for all intermediate layers as well, the latest entry in this list corresponds to the top layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **N.B.**: Make sure that when you run a sentence through your model, you do so within a `with torch.no_grad():` block, and that you have run `model.eval()` beforehand as well (to disable dropout).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **N.B.**: Make sure to use a token's ``[\"form\"]`` attribute, and not the ``[\"lemma\"]``, as the latter will stem any relevant morphological information from the token. We don't want this, because we want to feed well-formed, grammatical sentences to our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to stress that if you feel hindered in any way by the simple code structure that is presented here, you are free to modify it :-) Just make sure it is clear to an outsider what you're doing, some helpful comments never hurt."
